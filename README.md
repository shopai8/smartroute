# Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search on Vectors with Diverse Labels

This repository provides **SODA**, an enhanced implementation for **Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (Filtered ANNS)**. SODA improves **UNG (Unified Navigating Graph)** with an accelerated variant named **UNG+**, and further integrates the core ideas of **UNG+**, **FAVOR**, and **Pre-Filtering**. It introduces a new **AI-based intelligent routing** mechanism that adaptively schedules algorithms using a machine learning model. In addition, the improved version, **SODA+**, addresses cache thrashing caused by frequent switching among algorithms.

## 1. Preparation

### 1.1 Environment Setup

We conduct experiments on a Linux server with two Intel Xeon Gold 6342 processors, 144 threads, and 1 TB RAM. All algorithms are implemented in C++ and compiled with GCC 11.4.0. The project is built with CMake 4.3.2 and Boost 1.85.0.

The experimental environment is as follows:

- CPU: 2 × Intel Xeon Gold 6342 processors
- Threads: 144
- Memory: 1 TB RAM
- Compiler: GCC 11.4.0
- CMake: 4.3.2
- Boost: 1.85.0
- Python: 3.10.20

Configure the Python environment for the experiments using Conda.

Run the following command to create the required environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### 1.2 Data Preparation

Download the required datasets from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Paper4Review/SmartRoute_data) into the `data` folder in advance.

Please note that `data` is the default directory for storing datasets. The dataset collection includes eight datasets: Amazon, BookReviews, Genome, Laion, Music, Reviews, Tiktok, and VariousImg. Please store each dataset under the `data` directory using the same directory structure.

Each dataset contains the following files:

1. `*_random_300/`: This folder contains the query files used for testing. The wildcard `*` represents the dataset name.
2. `*_base_labels.txt`: This file contains the ground-truth labels corresponding to the base vectors.
3. `*_base.bin`: This binary file contains the base vectors of the dataset.
4. `*_base.fvecs`: This file stores the base vectors in `fvecs` format.

### 1.3 Repository Structure

The main structure of the repository is as follows:

```text
FilterVectorCode/
├── ACORN/                  # Implementation related to ACORN
├── NaviX/                  # Implementation related to NaviX
├── UNG/                    # UNG / UNG+ implementation and data-processing scripts
├── knowhere/               # Dependency for the Milvus baseline
├── FAVOR/                  # Dependency for the FAVOR baseline
├── data/                   # Dataset directory
├── experiment_json/        # Example experiment configurations
├── build_hybrid.sh         # Unified build script
├── generate_gt.sh          # Ground-truth generation script
├── search.sh               # Search and result aggregation script
├── exp.sh                  # Main experiment entry script
├── final_exp.sh            # Supplementary experiment entry script
├── generate_queries.sh     # Query generation script
├── generate_queries_config.json
└── environment.yml         # Recommended Conda environment
```

## 2. Experiments

Experiment configurations are stored in the `experiment_json/` directory.

### 2.1 Running Experiments

You can modify the experimental parameters and dataset paths in the corresponding configuration files before running the experiments.

Run the following command to start an experiment:

```bash
./exp.sh experiment_json/experiments-Genome-200-random-300-mix-len.json
```

### 2.2 Experiment Workflow

1. **Configuration Parsing**: `exp.sh` reads the `experiments` array from the JSON configuration file.
2. **Index Construction**: `build_hybrid.sh` is invoked to build indexes. The script supports the `parallel` mode, which builds the UNG index and ACORN index simultaneously.
3. **Ground-Truth Generation**: `generate_gt.sh` is invoked to compute the true nearest neighbors, which are used for recall evaluation.
4. **Search Execution**: `search.sh` is invoked to run the search process. It loads the pretrained ONNX router model for online scheduling.

## 3. Docker Environment

If you want a reproducible runtime environment for the current experiment configuration, you can use the provided `Dockerfile`.

### 3.1 Build the image

Run the following command in the repository root:

```bash
docker build -t filtervector:latest .
```

This image will:

- install the system toolchain required by `UNG`, `ACORN`, `NaviX`, `FAVOR`, and `Knowhere`
- create the Conda environment from `environment.yml`
- install `conan`
- build the local `knowhere` dependency in advance

### 3.2 Start a container

If your datasets and experiment outputs are stored on the host machine, it is better to mount only those directories into the container instead of copying them into the image.

Do **not** mount the whole repository over `/workspace/FilterVectorCode` unless you also plan to rebuild `knowhere` inside the container, because that would hide the prebuilt library baked into the image.

Example:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --name filtervector-dev \
  -v /your_path/FilterVector/FilterVectorData:/data \
  -v /your_path/FilterVector/FilterVectorResults:/results \
  -w /workspace/FilterVectorCode \
  filtervector:latest
```

Inside the container, you can then point your JSON configuration to:

- `data_dir: /data/<DatasetName>`
- `output_dir: /results`

### 3.3 Run experiments in the container

After entering the container, run:

```bash
conda activate vs
bash exp.sh experiment_json/202604-200-random-300-mix-len/experiments-Genome-200-random-300-mix-len.json
```

## 4. Core Parameters

The following parameters in the configuration files or scripts determine the behavior of the algorithms:

| Parameter | Description | Values / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ROUTING_MODE` | Determines the routing logic. | `0`: Baseline mode; `1`: **SODA**; `5`: **SODA+**. |
| `BASELINE_ALG` | Specifies the algorithm when `ROUTING_MODE=0`. | `0`: UNG; `2`: ACORN-gamma; `4`: NaviX; `5`: Pre-Filtering; `6`: ACORN-1; `8`: UNG+; `9`: Milvus-IVF; `10`: Milvus-HNSW; `11`: FAVOR; `12`: FAVOR-HNSW. |
| `BUILD_MODE` | Specifies the index construction mode. | `parallel`: Build all indexes in parallel; `acorn_only`: Build only the ACORN index. |
| `Lsearch` | Search parameter for UNG. | Similar to `efSearch` in HNSW; controls the search depth. |
| `efs_start/step` | Search parameters for ACORN/NaviX. | Used to dynamically adjust the filtering strength during search. |

## 5. Model Training and Deployment

The decision model for intelligent routing is trained using Python scripts:

- **Training**: Use `selector/smart_route_train.py`.
- **Deployment**: Export the trained model to `.onnx` format and place it in the `SelectModels` directory, where it can be loaded by the C++ `MethodSelector`.
